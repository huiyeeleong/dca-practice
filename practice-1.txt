1. Which command do you use to create a new swarm?
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>

2. What is this flag --advertise-addr for?
This flag configures the IP address for the manager node and the other nodes in the swarm must be able to access the manager at the IP address.
 
3. How do you know the current status of the swarm?
docker info // you can find the info under the swarm action

4. Which command do you use to find the information about the nodes in the swarm?
docker node ls

5. How to add another manager to the swarm?
// it generate the instruction for the manager to be added
docker swarm join-token manager

6. How to add another worker node to the swarm?
docker swarm join-token worker

7. How to run the container
docker container run <image>

8. What is the autolock feature in the Docker swarm?
When Docker restarts, both the TLS key used to encrypt communication among swarm nodes, and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs on disk, are loaded into each manager node’s memory.
Docker 1.13 introduces the ability to protect the mutual TLS encryption key and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs at rest, by allowing you to take ownership of these keys and to require manual unlocking of your managers. This feature is called autolock.

9. How to lock the swarm?
docker swarm init --autolock

10. How to unlock the swarm?
docker swarm unlock

11. Are we able to enable autolock feature only when we create a swarm for the first time?
No. You can lock the existing swarm as well

12. How to enable or disable autolock on the existing swarm?
//enable autolock
docker swarm update --autolock=true

//disable autolock
docker swarm update --autolock=false

13. How to view the current unlock key for the running swarm?
docker swarm unlock-key

14. How to rotate the unlock key?
docker swarm unlock-key --rotate

15. If the key was rotated after one of the manager nodes became unavailable and 
if you don’t have access to the previous key you may need to force the manager to leave the swarm and 
join it back as a new manager. Is this statement correct?
Yes

16. How to deploy a service in the docker swarm?
docker service create --replicas 3 --name nginx-web nginx

17. How to list the services in the Docker swarm?
